[[John Russell Taylor]] in ''Plays and Players'' praised the cast, which included [[Patricia Routledge]] as Berinthia and [[John Moffatt (actor)|John Moffatt]] as Lord Foppington, but complained that the production was \"full of the simpering, posturing and sniggering which usually stand in for style and sophistication in Restoration revivals.\"<ref>[http://alanhoward.org.uk/virtue.htm John Russell Taylor, review] in ''Plays and Players''.</ref> Following [[Donald Sinden]]'s outstanding and award-winning performance at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] in the mid-1970s Vanbrugh's original play is now again a favourite of the stage.
